By embracing minimalism, it aims to evoke a sense of tranquility and provide users with a clutter-free space conducive to efficient organization.

#### Colour Scheme
Colour created in Coolors.

The color scheme of the site predominantly features a blend of green and celadon (light gray). The primary focus was on maintaining a distinct header while ensuring that the background color for sign-in/up/out pages and list/item views is calm yet clearly delineates and distinguishes the content for the user.

The color palette was created using Coolors, while extracting the colors from the website was accomplished using Pick Color Online

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/BjornL1/projects/6)

The 5 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Stories execution.

## Data Model
I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views.  

Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.

To facilitate the management of shopping lists, a custom ShoppingList model was developed. Each shopping list is associated with a single user who acts as its owner. Therefore, the owner attribute of the ShoppingList model is a foreign key to the User model.

In addition to the ShoppingList model, a ShoppingListPreference model was implemented to handle user preferences related to shopping lists. This model allows users to specify whether a shopping list should be deleted or retained. . The user attribute of the ShoppingListPreference model is a foreign key to the User model, indicating that each preference setting is linked to a single user. Similarly, the shopping_list attribute is a foreign key to the ShoppingList model, indicating that each preference setting corresponds to a specific shopping list.

Furthermore, the Item model represents individual items within a shopping list. Each item is associated with a single shopping list, represented by the shopping_list attribute, which is a foreign key to the ShoppingList model. Additionally, the created_by attribute of the Item model signifies the user who created the item, and it is a foreign key to the User model, indicating that each item is linked to its creator.

The diagram below details the database schema.

![Database Scheme](docs/readme_images/database_scheme.png)

## Testing

Testing and results can be found [here](/TESTING.md)

## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User Authentication

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. 

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error. 

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom error pages:

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request - ToTheList is unable to handle this request.
- 403 Page Forbidden - Looks like you're trying to access forbidden content. Please log out and sign in to the correct account.
- 404 Page Not Found - The page you're looking for doesn't exist.
- 500 Server Error - ToTheList is currently unable to handle this request

## Features

### List management
All lists include the following information: Name, Number of Items (quantity), Clone Count, Public/Private status (button for list owner), View Items button, Edit/Clone Button.
Their presentation and options depend on whether the user owns the list or not. All lists owned by the logged-in user will be displayed first under the heading 'My Lists,' while public lists owned by other users are displayed under 'Other Lists'."

For lists owned by the logged-in user, the following additional information will be displayed:

- Name
